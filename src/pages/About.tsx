        I never imagined taking on candle making in my retirement so here’s the
        backstory.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        My wife and I were enjoying a blissful afternoon wine tasting with good
        friends at a California vineyard when I was put to task. On the oak
        table before us was an incredible magnum-sized wine bottle that had been
        artfully cut in half and repurposed as a stunning 3-wick candle.
        Everyone wanted one. However, the value of said candle . . . priceless;
        it’s not for sale. We were further advised that in the vineyard gift
        shop they have regular sized wine bottle candles but those will
        virtually sell out immediately whenever they have them; despite their
        astonishing price tag I would add.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Left brain logic and a love for working with my hands said “I can do
        this” despite no prior experience whatsoever. Thus, my craft was born.
        And, while I do produce a very limited number of wine bottle candles the
        engineering is demonstrably difficult and my inventory is always
        exhausted by our aforementioned wine loving cohorts. Those lofty prices
        make sense now!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Creating a good candle is much more involved than one would realize.
        There are innumerable types of waxes, dyes, fragrances, and wicks.
        Creating a candle formula calls upon disciplines in chemistry and math;
        the spreadsheets from my professional career have a newfound purpose!
        Many candles sold today are made from questionable foreign imports that
        contain phthalates and/or are carcinogenic when burned. I use phthalate
        free fragrances and an all-natural coconut wax that produces no
        carcinogens. The result is a clean burning candle with excellent aroma
        output.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        I produce these candles entirely by hand in very small batches so please
        appreciate any obvious variations as a testament to their handcrafted
        nature. Enjoy!
